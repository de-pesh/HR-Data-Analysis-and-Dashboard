# HR Insights Dashboard - Power BI Project

This repository contains a Power BI dashboard project designed to provide insights into HR-related metrics such as employee attendance, work from home (WFH) percentages, and sick leave (SL) percentages. The dashboard helps HR teams monitor and analyze employee trends over time, enabling data-driven decision-making.

## Overview

The **HR Insights Dashboard** focuses on three key metrics:

- **Attendance %**: The percentage of employees who were present during the selected period.
- **WFH %**: The percentage of employees working from home.
- **SL %**: The percentage of employees who took sick leave.

The dashboard offers visual representations of these metrics over time, making it easier to track fluctuations, analyze trends, and identify areas for improvement.
